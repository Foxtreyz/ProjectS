# What is Project S?

Project S is a new, fresh looking and easy to use alternative to Twitter. Both name and description may change once the project is ready.

This project is being developed by a single person (me).

The project is and will be always Open Source and licensed under the MIT License. If you want to collaborate, you're more than welcome!

Also, collaborators and helpers will get an special mention once the page is ready.
